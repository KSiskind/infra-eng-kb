# Grooming

## What and Why

"Backlog grooming, also referred to as backlog refinement or story time, is a recurring event for agile product development teams. The primary purpose of a backlog grooming session is to ensure the next few sprints worth of user stories in the product backlog are prepared for sprint planning. Regular backlog grooming sessions also help ensure the right stories are prioritized and that the product backlog does not become a black hole." (ProductPlan)

## When and Who

Backlog grooming sessions will take place mid-way in the two-week sprint cycle, i.e. on the weeks when Sprint Planning is not happening.  All scrum team members should participate.

## How

1. The Scrum Master shares their screen and pulls up the Jira project's backlog view.
1. The Scrum Master brings up tickets that have not been groomed; ideally, these are just the tickets that have been created since the last grooming meeting.  For each of these tickets:
    1. The team reviews it and discusses what to do w/ it.  For example:
        1. If the request is not valid, e.g. the work has been done already or it does not fit the current product direction, then the Scrum Master can simply close the ticket w/ the appropriate reason.
        1. If the request is unclear, then the Scrum Master will add a comment w/ questions for the requester to answer.
        1. If the ticket is too large, then the team can break it down into several stories or assign a team member to break it down after the meeting.
    1. Once the ticket is well-written and work-able, the team will add a Story Points estimate to it.
    1. The Scrum Master will then drag the groomed ticket into the backlog, ordering by priority.
1. The team should look over the backlog as a whole and come to a consensus that tickets are prioritized correctly.
